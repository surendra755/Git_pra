<h2><i>About JAVA</i></h2>
<h3>Here we list the basic features that make Java a powerful and popular programming language: </h3>
<p><u><b>Platform Independence</b></u>
The Write-Once-Run-Anywhere ideal has not been achieved (tuning for different platforms usually required), but closer than with other languages. </p>
<p><u><b>Object Oriented</b> </u>
Object oriented throughout - no coding outside of class definitions, including main(). 
An extensive class library available in the core language packages.</p>
<p><u><b>Compiler/Interpreter Combo </b></u>
Code is compiled to bytecodes that are interpreted by a Java virtual machines (JVM) . 
This provides portability to any machine for which a virtual machine has been written. 
The two steps of compilation and interpretation allow for extensive code checking and improved security.</p>
<p><u><b>Robust</b></u>
Exception handling built-in, strong type checking (that is, all data must be declared an explicit type), local variables must be initialized. </p>
<p><u><b>Several dangerous features of C & C++ eliminated: </b></u>
.No memory pointers  
.No preprocessor
.Array index limit checking 
.Automatic Memory Management 
.Automatic garbage collection - memory management handled by JVM.
.Security 
.No memory pointers 
.Programs runs inside the virtual machine sandbox. 
.Array index limit checking 
.Code pathologies reduced by 
.bytecode verifier - checks classes after loading 
.class loader - confines objects to unique namespaces. </p>
<p><u><b>Dynamic Binding </b></u>
The linking of data and methods to where they are located, is done at run-time. 
New classes can be loaded while a program is running. Linking is done on the fly. 
Even if libraries are recompiled, there is no need to recompile code that uses classes in those libraries. </p>
<p><u><b>Threading </b></u>
Lightweight processes, called threads, can easily be spun off to perform multiprocessing. 
Can take advantage of multiprocessors where available 
Great for multimedia displays.</p>
<p><u><b>Built-in Networking</b></u> 
Java was designed with networking in mind and comes with many classes to develop sophisticated Internet communications. </p>
