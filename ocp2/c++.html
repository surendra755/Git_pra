<h2><i>About C++</i></h2>
<p>
C++ has certain characteristics over other programming languages. The most remarkable ones are:

<h3><U>Object-oriented programming </u></h3>
The possibility to orientate programming to objects allows the programmer to design applications from a point of view more like a communication between objects rather than on a structured sequence of code. In addition it allows a greater reusability of code in a more logical and productive way.

<h3><U>Portability</u></h3> 
You can practically compile the same C++ code in almost any type of computer and operating system without hardly making any changes. C++ is the most used and ported programming languages in the world.

<h3><U>Brevity </u></h3>
Code written in C++ is very short in comparison with other languages, since the use of special characters is preferred to key words, saving some effort to the programmer (and prolonging the life of our keyboards!).

<h3><U>Modular programming </u></h3>
An application's body in C++ can be made up of several source code files that are compiled separately and then linked together. Saving time since it is not necessary to recompile the complete application when making a single change but only the file that contains it. In addition, this characteristic allows to link C++ code with code produced in other languages, such as Assembler or C. 

<h3><U>C Compatibility</u></h3> 
C++ is backwards compatible with the C language. Any code written in C can easily be included in a C++ program without hardly making any change.

<h3><U>Speed </u></h3>
The resulting code from a C++ compilation is very efficient, due indeed to its duality as high-level and low-level language and to the reduced size of the language itself.
